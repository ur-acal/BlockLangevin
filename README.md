# Experiments and Data for ``Provable Convergence Bounds for Hybrid Dynamical Sampling''
## Data
The files in `./data` and the notebook `./block_langevin/gaussian_plotting.ipynb` contain the data/utilities required to reproduce Figures 1 and 2 from the text.

## Experiments
The file `./block_langevin/bld.py` contains the code for running all experiments shown in the main text. Calling `python3 block_langevin/bld.py` is sufficient to generate the experimental results.
